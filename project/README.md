# Project Title Personal Portfolio for a Professional Website
### Video Demo:  <https://vimeo.com/781575931>
#### The project includes two webpages, an example of animations, and was focused on HTML and CSS.With VS code I created the main page, adding in different sections with HTML and stylizing those with CSS. This includes a header, footer, body, social media icons, and a menu navigation. I added an animation to the hero section. The contact form took me the longest amount of time, because although I upgraded my account after starting this project I haven't been able to integrate Javascript or PHP without errors that I need to solve with the hosting provider, so this provided another challenge to figure out how a message can be emailed to me using on HTML. I figured out how to use Form Submit to have a message forwarded.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites
Adobe fonts, Formsubmit

## How does it work?
You can click on links to external pages, links to certain sections, and send messages with the contact form.

You can click on "About Me" and it will jump to that section. you call fill out the email form and submit it.

## Technologies used:

Hostinger Web Hosting
Formsubmit
Adobe Fonts
bcryptjs
HTML
CSS stylsheet
Other small libraries and packages
Visual Studio Code

## Additional Information

I started by finding a hosting provider and registering a domain name.

With VS code I created the main page, adding in different sections with HTML and stylizing those with CSS. This includes a header, footer, body, social media icons, and a menu navigation. I added an animation to the hero section. The contact form took me the longest amount of time, because although I upgraded my account after starting this project I haven't been able to integrate Javascript or PHP without errors that I need to solve with the hosting provider, so this provided another challenge to figure out how a message can be emailed to me using on HTML. I figured out how to use Form Submit to have a message forwarded.

## Possible improvements
I see a great deal of opporunities for improvement, staring with getting access to adding in Javascript and other coding languages to make it more interesting and adding some layers of complexity. I would like to have more animations, hover changes, more stylized effects, and more style overall. Maybe also adding a menu with more external pages or to link to other sections.
